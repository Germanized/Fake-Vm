## 🚀 **What is VMFake?**

**VMFake** is a Python-based utility designed to emulate a virtual machine environment by creating registry keys and values associated with popular virtualization platforms and malware analysis tools. With this tool, you can:

- 🤖 Simulate the presence of different virtual machine environments.
- 🔧 Add registry keys and values for platforms like VMware, VirtualBox, and more!
- 🛡️ Fool security software into thinking you’re running on a real VM.
- 🕵️‍♂️ Test malware or run security tools in a virtual environment without needing actual VM software.

## 🌟 **Why VMFake?**

Let’s be honest—**ScareCrow VM** was a great idea, but not everyone can get their hands on it. And honestly, who wants to deal with proprietary, closed-source solutions when you can have an **open-source** and **customizable** tool like VMFake? 💪

**Germanized** is here to save the day! 🎩 We took inspiration from the best and brought you a solution that’s not only effective but also **accessible and transparent**. Say goodbye to the hassle of proprietary VM solutions and hello to freedom with VMFake! 🎊

## ⚙️ **Features**

- **Multi-Platform Emulation:** Simulate environments for VMware, VirtualBox, Parallels, and Hyper-V.
- **Malware Analysis Support:** Add registry keys for Cuckoo Sandbox, VirusTotal, Hybrid Analysis, and other malware analysis tools.
- **Easy to Use:** Just run the script and see it work its magic!
- **Open Source:** Completely free and open for you to contribute to or modify.

## 📦 **Installation**

To get started with VMFake, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:


git clone https://github.com/Germanized/Fake-Vm.git
cd VMFake
🏗️ Usage
Run the script to start simulating your virtual machine environment:


python VMfake.py
Follow the on-screen instructions to add various registry keys.

💡 How It Works
VMFake uses Python’s winreg module to create registry keys and values that mimic the presence of different virtual machine environments and malware analysis platforms. It’s like having a virtual machine on your own machine, without all the bloat! 🌟

Here’s a glimpse of what the tool does:
